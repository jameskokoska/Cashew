## App Links

Only supported in the Android and Web App versions as of now. Deep links allow direct navigation and automation of actions using application URLs. Some examples are below:

### Examples (for Android)

Ensure Cashew is installed on the device you are launching these URLs from.

#### Example 1: Create an expense transaction for 100 with the category Shopping at the current time

> https://cashewapp.web.app/addTransaction?amount=-100&title=All%20the%20shopping&category=Shopping&notes=Went%20shopping

#### Example 2: Create an income transaction with a missing category at the current time

> https://cashewapp.web.app/addTransaction?amount=100&title=Income&notes=Got%20money

#### Example 3: Open the add transaction page with a custom date with prefilled details

> https://cashewapp.web.app/addTransactionRoute?amount=-50&title=All%20the%20shopping&notes=Went%20shopping&date=2024-03-02

#### Example 4: Create multiple transactions with one link using JSON

> https://cashewapp.web.app/addTransaction?JSON=%7B%22transactions%22%3A%5B%7B%22amount%22%3A%22-100%22%2C%20%22notes%22%3A%22This%20is%20a%20note%22%2C%20%22category%22%3A%22Shopping%22%7D%2C%7B%22amount%22%3A%22-150%22%2C%20%22notes%22%3A%22This%20is%20a%20note%202%22%7D%5D%7D

See `JSON List of Transactions` below to view how the link is formatted.

### Routes

| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------- |
| `amount`      | The amount of the transaction. If negative, it represents an expense; if positive, it represents income.                                                                                                            | No       | 0               |
| `title`       | The title of the transaction. If an associated title is found and the category is not set, the associated title's category will be used.                                                                            | No       | Empty string    |
| `notes`       | The notes associated with the transaction.                                                                                                                                                                          | No       | Empty string    |
| `date`        | The date of the transaction. Supported string formats can be found in the `getCommonDateFormats()` method [here](https://github.com/jameskokoska/Cashew/blob/5.2.3%2B328/budget/lib/struct/commonDateFormats.dart). | No       | Current time    |
| `category`    | The name of the category to add the transaction to. Executes a name search, takes the first entry, not case sensitive.                                                                                              | No       | Prompt user     |
| `subcategory` | The name of the subcategory to add the transaction to. If provided, it overwrites the category if a subcategory is found under a main category. Executes a name search, takes the first entry, not case sensitive.  | No       | None            |
| `account`     | The name of the account. Executes a name search, takes the first entry, not case sensitive.                                                                                                                         | No       | Primary account |
| `JSON`        | A list of JSON objects of transactions. If provided, Cashew will import a list/multiple transactions at once. Each JSON object in the list can use any of the aforementioned parameters. The JSON object should be keyed with `transactions` followed by the list of objects. See the example below. | No       | None            |

### JSON List of Transactions
The input JSON for `addTransaction` and `addTransactionRoute` should follow the following format:
```JSON
{
  "transactions":[
    { ... },
    { ... },
    { ... }
  ]
}
```
As an example:
```JSON
{
  "transactions": [
    {
      "amount": "-100",
      "notes": "This is a note",
      "category": "Shopping"
    },
    {
      "amount": "-150",
      "notes": "This is a note 2"
    }
  ]
}
```

Don't forget to encode the JSON in the URL as JSON uses invalid URI characters. Once encoded, the output link would look something like:

> https://cashewapp.web.app/addTransaction?JSON=%7B%22transactions%22%3A%5B%7B%22amount%22%3A%22-100%22%2C%20%22notes%22%3A%22This%20is%20a%20note%22%2C%20%22category%22%3A%22Shopping%22%7D%2C%7B%22amount%22%3A%22-150%22%2C%20%22notes%22%3A%22This%20is%20a%20note%202%22%7D%5D%7D



### Testing

#### Using ADB

You can use ADB to test app links. For example

```shell
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "https://cashewapp.web.app/addTransaction?amount=-70\&title=Grocery%20Shopping\&date=2024-03-02\&category=Food\&subcategory=Groceries\&notes=Bought%20fruits%20and%20vegetables\&account=test"
```

#### Using links

You can click links and open them with Cashew. See the example section above to test.

## Developer Notes

### Pull Requests and Contributions

Unfortunately, I am currently not accepting contributions due to licensing and credits. Since this application turns some profits, I want to avoid any muddy water when it comes to compensation for contributions. You are free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/jameskokoska/Cashew/issues) and I can consider it!

### Android Release

- To build an app-bundle Android release, run `flutter build appbundle --release`

Note: required Android SDK.

### iOS Release

- To build an IPA iOS release, run `flutter build ipa`

Note: requires MacOS.

### Firebase Deployment

- To deploy to firebase, run `firebase deploy`

Note: required Firebase.

### GitHub release

- Create a tag for the current version specified in `pubspec.yaml`
- `git tag <version>`
- Push the tag
- `git push origin <version>`
- Create the release and upload binaries
- https://github.com/jameskokoska/Cashew/releases/new

### Scripts

`deploy_and_build_windows.bat`

- Deploy to Firebase and build the apk and appbundle

`open_release_builds.bat`

- Opens the location of the built apk and appbundle

`update_translations.bat`

- Downloads the latest version of Cashew translations. Runs `budget\assets\translations\generate-translations.py`

### Develop Wirelessly on Android

- `adb tcpip 5555`
- `adb connect <IP>`
- Get the phone's IP by going to `About Phone` > `Status Information` > `IP Address`

### Migrate Database

1. Make any database changes to the schema and tables
2. Bump the schema version
   - Change `int schemaVersionGlobal = ...+1` in `tables.dart`
3. Make sure you are in application root directory
   - `cd .\budget\`
4. Generate database code
   - Run `dart run build_runner build`
5. Export the new schema
   - Generate schema dump for the newly created schema
   - Replace `[schemaVersion]` in the command below with the value of `schemaVersionGlobal`
   - Run `dart run drift_dev schema dump lib\database\tables.dart drift_schemas//drift_schema_v[schemaVersion].json`
   - Read more: https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/advanced-features/migrations/#exporting-the-schema
6. Generate step-by-step migrations
   - Run `dart run drift_dev schema steps drift_schemas/ lib\database\schema_versions.dart`
7. Implement migration strategy
   - Edit `await stepByStep(...)` function in `tables.dart` and add the migration strategy for the new version migration

### Get Platform

- Use `getPlatform()` from `functions.dart`
- Since `Platform` is not supported on web, we must create a wrapper and always use this to determine the current platform

### Push Route

- If we want to navigate to a new page, stick to `pushRoute(context, page)` function from `functions.dart`
- It handles the platform routing and `PageRouteBuilder`

### Wallets vs. Accounts

- `Wallets` have been been renamed to `Accounts` on the front-end but internally, the name `Wallet` is still used.

### Objectives vs. Goals

- `Objectives` have been been renamed to `Goals` on the front-end but internally, the name `Objectives` is still used.

### Long Term Loans

- Long term loans create a goal. However, the goals total is not used. Instead the total of the goal is calculated by totalling the proper polarity of transactions of the opposite type. For example, if it was a loan of 100$ lent out, the initial transaction would be 100$ of negative polarity (expense) and that would be the total of the goal. When a payment is made, it is made in the opposite (positive) polarity (income) and added to the total 'paid back'. We can easily find how much is remaining by taking the difference (or the addition including polarities).
